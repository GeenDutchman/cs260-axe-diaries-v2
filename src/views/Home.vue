      <h1>Welcome to Axe Diaries!</h1>
      <p>A place to keep your party notes!</p>
      <p>
        We make it our business to help adventuring parties keep track of
        all the pesky details of their travel and victories. We ourselves
        have had some experience doing the same, and with the years, it
        becomes harder to rembember if we got our trusty Sword of Smiting
        from vanquishing Sinclair the "Milk" Merchant or as a reward for
        rescuing that one lass from Inhilm the snake-mage. If we had access
        to this product before, that would not have been a problem.
      </p>

        There is no more need for the entire party to "borrow" ink from the
        wizard any longer! No more binding loose papers in your pack! Simply
        have one of your casters summon one of our magic gray boxes, and
        then all can take turns speaking at it, and it will record your
        meaningful experiences!
      </p>
      <p>
        We are very grateful to those adventuring parties who have helped us
        get this far. Without them we would be poor digimancers with no way
        to strengthen our abilities. We are constantly working on making our
        summoning spell available at lower magnitutes for casters of all
        kinds, as well as improving our magic boxes so that even the most
        illiterate barbarian or the speaker of any estoric language can use
        our product!
